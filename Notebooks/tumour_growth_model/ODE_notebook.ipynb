    "# An introduction to Ordinary Differential Equations\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"pm-node nj-authors\">Marc Sturrock</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Inspired by source: <https://github.com/JuliaDiffEq/DiffEqTutorials.jl>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will get you started with DifferentialEquations.jl by introducing you to the functionality for solving ordinary differential equations (ODEs). The corresponding documentation page is the [ODE tutorial](https://docs.sciml.ai/DiffEqDocs/stable/getting_started/). While some of the syntax may be different for other types of equations, the same general principles hold in each case. The goal is to give a gentle and thorough introduction that highlights these principles in a way that will help you generalise what you have learned.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are new to the study of differential equations, it can be helpful to do a quick background read on [the definition of ordinary differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation). We define an ordinary differential equation as an equation which describes the way that a variable $u$ changes, that is\n",
    "\n",
    "$u' = f(u,p,t)$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $p$ are the parameters of the model, $t$ is the time variable, and $f$ is the nonlinear model of how $u$ changes. The initial value problem also includes the information about the starting value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u(t_0) = u_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, if you know the starting value and you know how the value will change with time, then you know what the value will be at any time point in the future. This is the intuitive definition of a differential equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## First Model: Exponential Growth\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first model will be the canonical exponential growth model. An exponential growth model can be used to model many natural phenomena, such as population growth in ecosystems, the spread of infectious diseases in a susceptible population, the accumulation of compound interest in finance, and the proliferation of cells in biology.  This model says that the rate of change is proportional to the current value, and is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u' = au$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we have a starting value $u(0)=u_0$. Let's say we put 1 dollar into Bitcoin which is increasing at a rate of $98%$ per year. Then calling now $t=0$ and measuring time in years, our model is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$u' = 0.98u$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $u(0) = 1.0$. We encode this into Julia by noticing that, in this setup, we match the general form when"

    "DifferentialEquations.jl has a common set of solver controls among its algorithms which can be found [at the Common Solver Options](http://docs.juliadiffeq.org/latest/basics/common_solver_opts.html) page. We will detail some of the most widely used options.\n",

    "### Tolerances\n",
    "\n",
    "The most useful options are the tolerances `abstol` and `reltol`. These tell the internal adaptive time stepping engine how precise of a solution you want. Generally, `reltol` is the relative accuracy while `abstol` is the accuracy when `u` is near zero. These tolerances are local tolerances and thus are not global guarantees. However, a good rule of thumb is that the total solution accuracy is 1-2 digits less than the relative tolerances. Thus for the defaults `abstol=1e-6` and `reltol=1e-3`, you can expect a global accuracy of about 1-2 digits. If we want to get around 6 digits of accuracy, we can use the commands:"

    "The use of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) in cancer modelling has its roots in the broader application of mathematical models in biology and medicine, which began in earnest in the early 20th century. One of the early applications of ODEs was in population dynamics, a field that shares many conceptual similarities with the study of cellular populations in cancer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advent of the \"Cancer by Numbers\" concept by Laird in the 1960s (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2071101/pdf/brjcancer00492-0080.pdf) brought mathematical modelling into the field of cancer research. The mathematical models then were simple, but they laid the groundwork for more complex models. Laird's work used probability and simple mathematical models to explore cancer cell growth, survival, and mutation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 1970s and 1980s, more complex ODE models began to appear. These models incorporated elements such as the cell cycle, the immune response, and the effects of chemotherapy. They began to portray cancer as a complex system, rather than a simple process of unchecked cell growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the turn of the 21st century, the development and application of ODE models in cancer research has exploded. This has been driven by several factors, including advances in computational power, the increasing availability of detailed biological data, and the recognition of the potential of mathematical models to improve our understanding of cancer and our ability to treat it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these advances, ODE modelling of cancer remains a very active field of research. Current challenges include the integration of multiscale models, which attempt to describe cancer from the molecular level up to the level of the whole organism, and the use of models to guide personalized treatment strategies."

In this model, the rate of tumour growth is fastest when the tumour is small, and slows as the tumour reaches its carrying capacity.\n",
